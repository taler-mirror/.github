This GitHub organisation is an automated mirror of the projects for [Taler](https://taler.net).

These mirrors are purely for browsing, for people who want a quick search result for gnu projects, and for people who prefer GitHub's modern tree browser to the less ubiquitous one at https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/.

Please do not interact with these repositories by cloning them, creating issues, forking them, opening pull requests, or otherwise. Instead, use the official source page for each project at https://git.taler.net/. A link to each project is provided in the description of its respective mirror repo.

The mirror repos are (or aim to be) updated daily.

This mirror project is wholly unofficial and unauthorised. No guarantee is given of mirrors being secure or up-to-date. Projects are reproduced in accordance with the terms of their Free Software licenses, which can usually be found in their COPYING file.
